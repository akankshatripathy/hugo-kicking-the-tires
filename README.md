# hugo-kicking-the-tires

This repo contains the code to build a simple hugo site, and includes a handful of content pages 
as well as defined layouts for those respective pages. This code is simplistic and contains duplicates, 
but has the intent of allowing one to practice with hugo commands. 

Use $ hugo server to run the development web server. Visit http://localhost:1313/ to view the page.
